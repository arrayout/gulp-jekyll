I have designed many interfaces, wrote tons of CLI commands and called an high number of restful APIs at **Satispay**, an app to share money with friends and pay in store.

I am working with a ton of backend developers supporting marketing team, thanks to newsletter and landing pages tracking data in order to achieve businessâ€™ goal.

Daily, I am facing up with scaling challenges. Consequently, I have begun to give the right attention to the system logging and the discovering cache benefits.

I get my hands dirty on different projects at [satispay.com][satispay-www]{:target="_blank"}, [spot.satispay.com][satispay-spot]{:target="_blank"} the merchants dashboard and other internal applications.
