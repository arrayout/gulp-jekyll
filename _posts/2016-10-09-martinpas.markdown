This is my special project. Iâ€™m a co-founders of Martin Pas, a physical and an online store [www.martinpas.com][martinpas-www]{:target="_blank"} that sells synthesizers.

Martin Pas is a truly example of lean startup approach. We have decided to be in the game in a short time without wasting time, even in a very rudimentary form, learning from the customers feedback.

I have been working on this project during my spare time in the last 8 months.

I have developed the main idea and I have worked with [yetmatilde studio][yetmatilde-www]{:target="_blank"}	 - the company when I have been working from 2009 to 2013 - on the interior design concept and the corporate identity.

I have developed the e-commerce platform using [moltin][moltin-www]{:target="_blank"}, an API service that handles data storage and eCommerce logic in the cloud. I have chosen it in order to focus all the project on the customer experience.

At Martin Pas I develop new features on website, thinks how to expand the business and create digital marketing campaign to increase brand awareness on Facebook and google.
