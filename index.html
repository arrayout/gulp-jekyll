		<h4>Vertical Rhythm</h4>
		<p class="monospace">Space in typography is like time in music. It is infinitely divisible, but a few proportional intervals can be much more useful than a limitless choice of arbitrary quantities.</p>
		<p>
		So says the typographer Robert Bringhurst, and just as regular use of time provides rhythm in music, so <b>regular use of space provides rhythm in typography</b>, and without rhythm the listener, or the reader, becomes disorientated and lost.

		<h4>Atomic Design</h4>
		<p class="monospace">The approach also forces you to think how something works in relation to the whole site, rather than just a specific page, making it easier to add more pages later on.</p>
		<p>Starting development by <b>creating a style guide makes a lot more sense</b> than developing on a page-by-page basis.

		<h4>Web accessibility</h4>
		<p>When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality. Once we have a site that is usable in lynx then we would open the browser and start styling the pages with CSS.
